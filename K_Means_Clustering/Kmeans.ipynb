    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Implementing K-means\n",
    "\n",
    "The K-means algorithm is a method to automatically cluster similar data examples together. Concretely, you are given a training set $\\{x^{(1)} , \\cdots, x^{(m)}\\}$ (where $x^{(i)} \\in \\mathbb{R}^n$), and want to group the data into a few cohesive “clusters”. The intuition behind K-means is an iterative procedure that starts by guessing the initial centroids, and then refines this guess by repeatedly assigning examples to their closest centroids and then recomputing the centroids based on the assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "The K-means algorithm is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "centroids = kMeansInitCentroids(X, K)\n",
    "for i in range(iterations):\n",
    "    # Cluster assignment step: Assign each data point to the\n",
    "    # closest centroid. idx[i] corresponds to cˆ(i), the index\n",
    "    # of the centroid assigned to example i\n",
    "    idx = findClosestCentroids(X, centroids)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    # Move centroid step: Compute means based on centroid\n",
    "    # assignments\n",
    "    centroids = computeMeans(X, idx, K)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The inner-loop of the algorithm repeatedly carries out two steps: (1) Assigning each training example $x^{(i)}$ to its closest centroid, and (2) Recomputing the mean of each centroid using the points assigned to it. The K-means algorithm will always converge to some final set of means for the centroids. Note that the converged solution may not always be ideal and depends on the initial setting of the centroids. Therefore, in practice the K-means algorithm is usually run a few times with different random initializations. One way to choose between these different solutions from different random initializations is to choose the one with the lowest cost function value (distortion). You will implement the two phases of the K-means algorithm separately\n",
